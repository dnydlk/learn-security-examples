Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
  The vulnerability of the insecure version is that there is no logging or tracking of user actions. This means that there is no way to prove that a user performed a certain action. In the secure version, detailed logging implemented. Each request is logged with a timestamp, the type of request, the URL, and the user's IP address. 

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
  To prevent such attacks, additional security mechanisms can be incorporated such as implementing multi-factor authentication, using secure communication protocols like HTTPS.
