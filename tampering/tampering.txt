The insecure version directly uses user input without any sanitization or escaping. This approach can lead to XSS attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage viewed by others. Since the user input is directly incorporated into the webpage without any filtering or escaping, if an attacker were to enter HTML or JavaScript code as their name, this code could be executed in the browsers of other users visiting the page, leading to potential security breaches such as cookie theft, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.

The secure version introduces a critical security improvement by adding an escapeHTML function, which is used to sanitize user input before it is used within the application. This function replaces special HTML characters in the input (such as &, <, >, ", and ') with their respective HTML symbols (&amp; etc) This prevents any malicious input from being interpreted as executable code in the browser, effectively mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
